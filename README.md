I demonstrate the simulation of a MicroBlaze processor on an FPGA using Vivado and Vitis 2023.2 :
SDK Folder Contains helloworld.c *(VITIS : application program).
VIVADO Folder Contains testbench.vhd *(VIVADO : testbench).
array_sum.pdf Contains instructions *(FOLLOW : along).
array_sum.txt Contains instructions *(YOU : need : Codes are also included here, along with more specific settings{Step by step}).
